# Profile App
This is a simple React app that showcases the use of functional components to display a profile photo, full name, and address.

## Instructions
- Create a project using `create-react-app`(Example 1- `npx create-react-app my-app` 2- `cd my-app` 3-`code .`).
- Create `App.js` file in src folder and use it as a root component for your React app.
- Create a profile folder (path: src/Component/Profile).
- Inside the Profile folder, create three components: `ProfilePhoto.js`, `FullName.js`, and `Address.js`.
- `ProfilePhoto.js`: a functional component that returns a photo of your profile.
- `FullName.js`: a functional component that returns your full name.
- `Address.js`:  a functional component that returns your address.
- Import the profile components into `App.js` and use them.
- Style your app as desired.
## Conclusion

In this project, you have learned how to create React components and use JSX to render components in your app. The project provides a basic structure for creating a profile, but feel free to modify and expand it as needed.
